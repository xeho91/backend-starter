## Project structure

Below is a quick navigation on how to navigate this project **directories**.

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ [1] .husky
â”œâ”€â”€ [2] apps
â”œâ”€â”€ [3] coverage
â”œâ”€â”€ [4] docs
â”œâ”€â”€ [5] packages
â””â”€â”€ [6] types
```

Where as:

-   `1` -> Git hooks used with [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
-   `2` -> [binary packages _(applications)_](./apps/README.md)
-   `3` -> auto-generated _(by [Vitest])_ tests coverage _(ignored by default via `.gitignore`,)_
-   `4` -> auto-generated _(by [TypeDoc])_ documentation site _(ignored by default via `.gitignore`)_
-   `5` -> [library packages](./packages/README.md)
-   `6` -> types for the workspace
