## Project structure

Below is a quick navigation on how to navigate this project workspace root **directories**.

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ [1] .husky
â”œâ”€â”€ [2] apps
â”œâ”€â”€ [3] coverage
â”œâ”€â”€ [4] docs
â”œâ”€â”€ [5] packages
â””â”€â”€ [6] types
```

Where as:

-   [`[1] .husky`](./.husky/README.md) -> Git hooks setup for this project powered by [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
-   [`[2] apps`](/apps/README.md) -> binary packages _(applications)_
-   `[3] coverage` -> auto-generated _(by [Vitest])_ tests coverage _(ignored by default via `.gitignore`)_
-   `[4] docs` -> auto-generated _(by [TypeDoc])_ documentation site _(ignored by default via `.gitignore`)_
-   [`[5] packages`](./packages/README.md) -> library packages
-   [`[6] types`](./types/README.md) -> types for the workspace
